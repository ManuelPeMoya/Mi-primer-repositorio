    <h1>Building MSF</h1>
    <p>Since 1980, <mark>MSF has opened offices in 28 countries</mark> and employs more than 30,000<br>
        people across the world. Since its founding, <mark>MSF has treated over a hundred million<br>
        patients.</mark></p>
    <p><mark>MSF has also maintained itsinstitutional and financial independence</mark>, and the<br>
        organization has continued to be critical of both itself and the broader aid system<br>
        when appropriate, all in the name of trying to help direct more effective and timely<br>
        aid to those who need it most.</p>
