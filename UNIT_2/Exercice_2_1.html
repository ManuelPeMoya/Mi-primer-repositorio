    <h1>Doctors without borders</h1>
    <p>In May 1968, a group of young doctors decided to go and help victims of wars and<br>
        major disasters. This new brand of humanitarianism would reinvent the concept of<br>
        emergency aid. <strong>They were to become Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), known<br>
            internationally in English as Doctors Without Borders.</strong></p>
