    <h1>Aplication Web</h1>
    <p>A <del>Aplicaciones web</del> <ins>web application</ins> (or web app) is application software that runs on a web server,
         unlike computer-based software programs that are stored locally on the Operating System (OS) of the device.
         Web applications are accessed by the user through a web browser with an active <del>conexión a internet</del><ins>internet connection.</ins> 
         These applications are programmed using a client–server modeled structure—the user ("client")
        is provided services through an off-site server that is hosted by a third-party. Examples of commonly-used web applications include: 
        <del>correo electronico</del> <ins>web-mail</ins>, online retail sales, online banking, and online auctions.</p>
