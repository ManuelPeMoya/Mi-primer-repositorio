    <h1>People first</h1>
    <p>MSF was officially created on December 22, 1971. At the time, 300 volunteers made up<br>
        the organization: doctors, nurses, and other staff, including the 13 founding<br>
        doctors and journalists.</p>
    <p><em>MSF was created on the belief that all people have the right to medical care<br>
        regardless of gender, race, religion, creed, or political affiliation</em>, and that the<br>
        needs of these people outweigh respect for national boundaries.</p>
