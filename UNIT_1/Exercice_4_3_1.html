    <h1>Poems</h1>
    <h2>William Shakespeare</h2>
    <p>Be not afraid of greatness.<br>
    Some are born great,<br>
    some achieve greatness,<br>
    and others have greatness thrust upon them.</p>

    <h2>As autumn falls</h2>
    <p>Shrouded in golden leaves,<br>
        we wait.<br>
        The world doesn’t end at sunset<br>
        and only dreams<br>
        limit themselves to things.<br>
        Through a labyrinth of blank hours<br>
        time leads us on<br>
        as autumn falls<br>
        over our house, our patio.<br>
        Shrouded in a relentless fog<br>
        we wait, we wait:<br>
        nostalgia means to live without remembering<br>
        the word we are made of.</p>


    <h2>To become one with music</h2>
    <p>You are in need of everything:<br>
        grey roads,<br>
        deep glooms,<br>
        birds that sing even in silence;<br>
        the sky,<br>
        an autumn leaf,<br>
        hands empty,<br>
        love unreturning,<br>
        snow’s whiteness;<br>
        dawn lights,<br>
        you are in need of everything the dream requires,<br>
        to become one with the music<br>
        of the most faraway blues<br>
        so that eventually your soul<br>
        will have confidence in death.</p>
